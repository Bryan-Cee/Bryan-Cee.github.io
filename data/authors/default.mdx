Hey! I'm **Bryce**, a Frontend Engineer with a knack for turning design ideas into awesome interactive user interfaces and experiences. I've been in the coding game for over half a decade and counting, right now, I'm making things happen as a **Software Engineer at Microsoft**.

My job? Building tools that make life easier for engineers so they can create kickass, user-friendly products. I thrive on the sweet spot where design meets functionality.

On this site, you'll find a showcase of my journey in the world of coding and design. From pixel-perfect layouts to robust code structures, I'm all about making things look good and work even better.
